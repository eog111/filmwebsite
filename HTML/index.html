        <p class="info">“The Tomatometer.” This represents the percentage of positive reviews for a given film or show. The Tomatometer score is calculated after five reviews.
            <br>As the reviews come in, The Tomatometer measures the positive reviews against the negative ones and assigns either an overall score of fresh or rotten rating to the film or television show.  
            A red tomato score indicating its fresh status is designated when at least 60% of the reviews are positive. 
            A green splat indicating rotten status, is displayed when less than 60% of the reviews are positive.

            <u> Rating:  </u>Ratings are essentially percentages, measuring the portion of a given group — be it households, adults 18-49 or women 25-54 — watching a given show. Adults 18-49 is the primary demographic by which ad rates are set for entertainment programming, so it’s the most commonly reported (one point in that demo equals 1.28 million people). So a 2.0 rating for a show means that 2 percent of people in that age range, roughly 2.56 million people, watched the show.<br>
            <u> Share:</u>  The percentage of a given group who are watching TV at that time and are tuned into a given program. So if Wednesday’s show airing had a 10 share in adults 18-49 (10 percent of adults under 50, who had their TVs on at that hour, watched it). It’s typically written as “rating/share”.</p>
